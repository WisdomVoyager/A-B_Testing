# Cookie_Cats_A-B_Testing_Project

The Cookie Cats A/B testing Python project involves analyzing player retention rates when shifting the in-game gate placement from level 30 to level 40. 

By employing bootstrap analysis, the project assesses how gate positioning affects player engagement, considering theories like hedonic adaptation to explain observed retention differences.

Conclusion of the analysis-

The bootstrap analysis indicates a 94.2% probability of higher 1-day retention when the gate is at level 30. Moreover, 7-day retention is considerably higher at level 30 with a 100% probability. This underscores the importance of gate placement for maintaining strong retention rates. The theory of hedonic adaptation explains the observed higher retention at an earlier gate position, suggesting that enforced breaks enhance player enjoyment and reduce boredom, leading to better long-term engagement.
